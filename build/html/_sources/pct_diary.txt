2015-04-27 Project start
------------------------

* Migrated code from lab
* Outline project, setup git
* Refactoing the draw map function into smaller functions
    * sepparate drawing functions for bars and circles
    * sepparete function for calculating positon

I first wanted to make a generic element drawing function with different
input parameters, but the decided against it because of the fine tuning
required for each element
