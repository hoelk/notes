Microwave remote sensing

Black body:
*  perfect absorber
*  perfect emitter

Brightness of frequency band depends only on frequency and temperature

Wiens displacement law

Maximum radiation wavelength is temperature times constant

Bolzmann law:

You get yotal brightness by just integrating over the frequencies


Generate microwaves:

Take a stick of metal and apply a current

wavenumber k = (2 pi / wavelength)


FNBW first null beam width = 2 * wavelength / length of antenna
    narrow beam: we need small wavelength, or long antenna

c = 3 * 10**8 m/s

c = s / t   (s is our wavelength) --->

f = 3 * 10**8 * wavelength Hz
