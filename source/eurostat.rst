ESTP: Introduction to Big Data and its tools
############################################

* Worldwide data production grows rapidly, f.e. google processes 5 petabytes
(10^15) bytes per hour (as much as the whole US postal service handles in a
year)
* Storage and Processing power also grows rapidly

Definition:

What is big data
Data that is so big and/or complex that it cannot be processed using
existing tools (data bases, processing applications). That means what was big
data two years ago is not necessarily big data today.

What is big:
In the big data discussion size is usually discussed in 4 dimensions:
* Volume (how much data is created),
* Variety/Complexity - How structutred is the data (social meida, sensor data, example: youtube videos that contain cats)
* Veloctiy (how fast is the data created)
* Varacity: Inaccuray of data. Big data is usually not created with a specific
purpose in mind, but is rather a by-product of other activities, so data quality
is often not ensured at creation


International Activities on Big Data in Official Statistics

* Big Data is a complex topic and no country has the ressources to effectively
    work on Big Data problems without internaional cooparation.

* Big Data contains summaries from a big data workshop in 2015, also stuff
that concerns us, check it out

* ESSnet provides UNECE big data sanbox (hadoop, spark, r studio) till 2018,
subscription basis (nonprofit but support costs, 10.000 $ per anno)
